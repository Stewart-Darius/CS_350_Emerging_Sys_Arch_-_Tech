# CS_350_Emerging_Sys_Arch_-_Tech

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
This project utilized the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL board to develop an IoT application focused on controlling hardware components through interface software. The objective was to solve the challenge of creating efficient software for hardware interaction while analyzing architectural considerations and their impact on performance. By achieving this, the project showcased the potential of emerging system architectures in real-world applications.

**What did you do particularly well?**
One of the strongest aspects of my work was troubleshooting and adapting to challenges during development. I successfully navigated technical issues in hardware setup and configuration, ensuring that the system performed as intended. Additionally, my ability to write clear and organized documentation added value, making the project accessible for future adaptation or review.

**Where could you improve?**
I could improve by deepening my understanding of the hardware's architectural design and its implications on application optimization. While functional, the project could benefit from further exploration into advanced performance metrics and architectural efficiencies. This focus would enhance the quality of future work and the depth of my technical expertise.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
Through this project, I added several tools and resources to my support network, such as TI Code Composer Studio and community forums for IoT developers. These tools have become essential for troubleshooting and staying informed about best practices in hardware-software integration.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
The skills I gained, particularly in interface software development, problem-solving, and project documentation, are highly transferable to other projects. These competencies will aid me in tackling similar challenges and enhancing collaboration in team settings.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
To make the project maintainable and adaptable, I followed clean coding practices and provided comprehensive documentation. The modular design of the software ensures it can be easily extended or modified for future applications. This approach ensures that the project remains valuable for both personal and professional growth.
